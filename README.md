A Python-based simulator for a 1D n-channel MOSFET. This project numerically solves the fundamental semiconductor physics equations to model the electrostatic behavior and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a MOS transistor.

## Core Physics
The simulation is based on the self-consistent solution of the 1D Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the semiconductor substrate under the gate. This allows for the calculation of key physical quantities like surface potential and charge distribution in depletion, accumulation, and inversion regimes. The drain current is then modeled using the Pao-Sah double integral and drift-diffusion approximation.

## Key Features
- Calculates and plots the **band diagram** of the MOS capacitor.
- Determines the **charge density profile** (electrons, holes, ionized dopants).
- Generates the **Id-Vg (transfer)** characteristic curve.
- Generates the **Id-Vd (output)** characteristic curves.
- Allows for user-defined physical parameters (doping concentration, oxide thickness, etc).

## Visual Results
Here are some example plots generated by the simulator.

**1. Transfer Characteristic (Id vs. Vg)**
*Shows the transition from subthreshold to strong inversion.*
